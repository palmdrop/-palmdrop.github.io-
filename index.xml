      <description>&lt;p&gt;Combining domain warping and modified noise functions can produce extremely detailed and varied alien-like textures and shapes. This post is a peek into how I&amp;rsquo;ve been using these techniques to create pieces of generative art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Characteristics of Modified Noise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regular gradient noise, such as Perlin and Simplex noise, is extremely useful for procedurally generating textures, flowfields, heightmaps, etc. But a texture or heightmap created using plain noise is rarely that interesting. Often, noise is modified or used in unique, creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My take on domain warping</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Domain warping: a procedural method for generating natural-looking patterns and shapes. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this technique for a long time, and the results can be beautiful and strangely organic. This post will explore my (slightly different) approach, and some of the images this approached helped produce.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite natural that new technologies and emerging media eventually are used as artistic tools. Digital art has been created for decades, there&amp;rsquo;s been a recent boom in AI art, and there are huge communities of generative artists working with code as their creative medium.
For many years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using generative/procedural techniques to learn more about programming and digital technologies, and simultaneously to realize my more aesthetic pursuits. I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with well-known techniques such as domain warping and particle simulations, while also spending time with my own concepts and ideas.</description>
